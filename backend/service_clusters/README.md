# Service Clusters
<p>This is where Service Clusters will reside (ex: Utility Service Cluster). Service Clusters are collections of unrelated, but 
categorical microservices. 
</br>
</br>
For example, Utility is the categorical archetype for collections of services such as <i>Auth_Service</i> or <i>Notification_Service</i>, in the <i>Utility_Service_Cluister</i>.</p>
