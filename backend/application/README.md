# Welcome to the Application Layer
<p>Here, directories are divided by feature. Please refer to the architecture on /backend/back-end_architecture.pdf for assistance 
with navigation. The Application Layer accepts a "contract" of parameter (TBD) from the Presentation Layer, process it (by making service calls), and returns it back to the Presentation Layer / consumer. <b>It will either also be exposed over HTTP, or will reside underneath the Presentation Layer</p>
