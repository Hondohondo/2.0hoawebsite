# Services
<p>This is the Service central home. Services are divided by feature, allowing for horizontal scalability.</p>
<p>Every Service has the following directories: 
 <ul>
  <li>agents (for the <feature>agent.cs)</li>
  <li>microservices (for the necessary internal microservices, ex: Ticket_CRUD_Service)</li>
  <li>db_direct-access_service-proxy (a proxy sitting on top of the DB)</li>
 </ul>
</p>
